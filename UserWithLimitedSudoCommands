Set Up a user that can run only some command with sudo:

    Create a new sudoers file in the /etc/sudoers.d directory that will contain a standalone entry for webmasters:

     sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/web_admin

    Enter in the following at the top of the file:

     Cmnd_Alias  WEB = /bin/systemctl restart httpd.service, /bin/systemctl reload httpd.service

    Add another line in the file for gfreeman to be able to use the sudo command in conjunction with any commands listed in the WEB alias:

     gfreeman ALL=WEB

    Save and close the file with :wq!.

    Next, log in to the gfreeman account:

     sudo su - gfreeman

    Attempt to restart the web service:

     sudo systemctl restart httpd.service

    Try to read the new web_admin sudoers file:

     sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/web_admin

    Since the cat command is not listed in the command alias group for WEB, gfreeman cannot use sudo to read this file.
